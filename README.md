# OSIAT
**Version pre-alpha 1.1.0**
A Terminal Operating System only using Python 3. This idea was in the "random ideas" repository and i attempted to make it. This, obviously should not be used as your main operating system as it probably won't have enough content or commands to be used in your day-to-day life.
